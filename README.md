## Website Description
### **Purpose** 
The purpose of this website is to advertise myself and my skills to future employers. It will be something that I will update frequently throughout my career as I develop new skills and projects.

### **Funtionality/ features**
The website has some basic javascript funtionality in the navbar when the site is in a mobile viewport-size. The JavaScript allows the navbar to slide smoothly in and out of the screen when the user clicks on the burger menu.

The site features 5 main pages, Home, About, Work, Blog and Contact. The blog page allows the user to click on a preview of each blog post. This link will take them to a seperate Blog-view page where the user can read the full blog post.
